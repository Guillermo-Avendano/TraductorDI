Active users
sessionID
No one active user cannot be listed. This may be due to insufficient operator privileges of the current (missing ''S'' operator privilege?).
Error while re-organizing the application {0}. The application is in use by other users.
However the current user has the ''S'' operator privilege, so it should be able to force disconnection of other users.
The ''S'' operator privilege is required to force disconnection of other users.
Cannot re-organize the application {0} in a gentle way (re-organization state is {1}). The application is probably in user by other users.
Error while checking if some applications needed to be re-organized
But the re-organization has been approved only if it could be done in gentle way (what is not the case). Manually force the re-organization or edit web.xml and change the setting ''enforceReOrganizationsIfNeeded'' to ''true''.
The current user has not enough privilege to force the re-organization. Ask an administrator to do it.

A node that corresponds to an ETL transformation scoped by a procedure, trigger or function. The node also includes Information about the superordinate schema, database, and DB system.
A node that corresponds to an ETL transformation scoped by a view. The node also includes Information about the superordinate schema, database, and DB system.
A node that corresponds to a table scoped by a procedure, trigger or function. The node also includes Information about the superordinate schema, database, and DB system.
A node that corresponds to a table in the scope of an OOP item class or method. The node also includes Information about the superordinate OOP package.
A node that corresponds to a table in the scope o an ETL task or transformation. The node also includes information about the superordinate task and system.
If the item in the technical diagram is a business item, e.g., Critical Data Element, the item''s name itself is taken as business name.
If the item is a technical item, e.g., Column or Field, the business name is taken from the linked business term following these rules:\n1. Take the business term that links to the technical item directly.\n2. Otherwise, take the business term that links to the nearest level in the item''s name space parentage.
If more than one term is found on the same level, the alphabetically first term is displayed, and the diagram node shows "[...]" after the business name.\nIf no business term is found, the text "[Unknown Business Name]" is displayed.
If the item is a transformation related item, e.g., Transformation Map, the business name is taken from the linked business term following these rules:\n1. Take the business term that links to the transformation related item directly.\n2. Otherwise, take the business term that links to the nearest level in the item''s name space parentage.
If more than one term is found on the same level, the alphabetically first term is displayed, and the diagram node shows "[...]" after the business name.\nIf no business term is found, the text "Transformation" is displayed.
If the item is a report field, the business name is taken from the report/report structure that represents the field following these rules:\n1. Take the report that is parent of the field.\n2. Take the report that uses the field.\n3. Otherwise take the report structure that contains the field.
If more than one report is found on the same level, the alphabetically first report is displayed, and the diagram node shows "[...]" after the report name.\nIf no report/report structure is found, the text "[Unknown Report]" is displayed.
If the item in the technical diagram is a business item, a technical item, or a transformation related item, the application name is determined following these rules:\n1. Take the application that links to the item directly.\n2. Else, take the application that links to the nearest level in the item''s name space parentage.\n3. Otherwise, take the application that links directly to the business term that has been determined for the item as business name.
If the item is a report field, the application name is determined following these rules:\n1. Take the application that links to the report field directly.\n2. Else, take the application that links to the nearest level in the report field''s name space parentage.\n3. Otherwise, take the application that links directly or via its name space parents to the report that uses the report field.
If more than one application is found on the same level, the alphabetically first application is displayed, and the diagram node shows "[...]" after the application name.\nIf no application is found, the text "[Unknown Application]" is displayed.
The business name nodes are condensed to display the incoming terms (most left, one or more) and the outgoing terms (most right, one or more).
Intermediate transformations are not displayed as long as they also belong to the same application as their source and target, or no application at all.
If the same business term is used for different items within the same application, they are condensed into one node and "[...]" is displayed after the business name.
Missing business names - displayed as "[Unknown Business Name]" or "[Unknown Report]" - are not condensed.
These rules are fixed and cannot be adjusted.
